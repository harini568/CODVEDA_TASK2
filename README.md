The form will include essential input fields such as Name, Email, Phone Number, and Password. These fields will be checked for various criteria using JavaScript. For example, the Name and Email fields should not be empty, the Email must follow a proper format (like example@gmail.com), the Phone Number should contain only digits and be of a specific length (usually 10 digits), and the Password must meet strength criteria like a minimum of 6 characters, including letters, numbers, or symbols.

As users interact with the form, your JavaScript code will handle focus and blur events. When a user clicks into an input (focus), you can highlight the field or show a helpful hint. When they move away from the input (blur), you check if the value is valid and show an error message if needed—this is what we call real-time validation.

These error messages will be shown dynamically below each input field, so the user knows what went wrong immediately—without refreshing the page. If all inputs are valid and the form is submitted, a success message or confirmation should be displayed.

On the design side, the form should be styled using CSS to appear neat, clean, and professional. Use appropriate spacing, font sizes, border styles, colors, and maybe icons to make the form both user-friendly and visually appealing.

This task helps you understand how JavaScript works with the DOM (Document Object Model), how events like input, focus, and blur can be used to improve user experience, and how you can build real-world forms for websites and applications.
